# Programming Assignment #4
This project demonstrates the use and application of python codes and functions for effective data wrangling and visualization. This project also uses Matplotlib to create bar charts for visualizing the average scores from a dataframe.
## Description
1. Loading data
   - The graph from 'Board2.csv' is read as a base for building codes.
2. Filtering data
   - Script filters specific rows and columns based on conditions.
3. Calculating Average
   - Script calculates average score across multiple formats.5. Plotting average to compare datas.
4. Plotting average to compare datas
   - Matplotlib is used to create bar charts and visualize the comparison between categories.
## Dependencies
## Executing Program
### Problem 1
1. Ensure dependencies
   - Install the necessary libraries.
2. Prepare data
   - Ensure the dataset file that will be used is in your working directory or update the file path in the function accordingly.
3. Run the script
   - Execute the script in your environment.
### Problem 2
1. Ensure dependencies
   - Install the necessary libraries.
2. Prepare data
   - Ensure the dataset file that will be used is in your working directory or update the file path in the function accordingly.
3. Data filtering and manipulation
   - Make a script that reads the dataset and creates filtered dataFrames based on specific conditions.
4. Run the script
   - Execute the script in your environment.
## Conclusion
### Problem 1
   - This problem effectively demonstrates data wrangling techniques to showcase how to filter data based on multiple conditions, get averages, and save specific subsets of data to CSV files for further analysis.
### Problem 2
   - This problem demonstrates how to use Matplotlib to generate bar charts for comparing average scores across different categorical variables within the dataset.
